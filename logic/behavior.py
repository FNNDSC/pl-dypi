str_about = '''
    The behavior module codifies the operational/dynamic behavior of this
    plugin.

    Primary behaviors include some conditional logic over the space of
    input objects, and triggering a resultant operation -- usually this means
    copying the object into a child plugin, and then running a pipeline 
    on the result of that copy-to-child.
